# shallow-wave-simulation-INF585
Implementation of a Shallow Wave Simulator as part of the course INF585 on Computer Animation - Ecole Polytechnique

### Setup :
For the shallow wave code to run, you need to download the cgp library available on the github page of Damien Rohmer (link: )

The project direcotry should be of the format :

root
├── project-code-INF585
├── cgp

### Results :
